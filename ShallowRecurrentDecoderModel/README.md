## Abstract

This project investigates the use of the SHRED (Shallow Recurrent Decoder) model for reconstructing sea-surface temperature (SST) fields from sparse sensor data. The SHRED model combines a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a shallow decoder to reconstruct high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields from limited and noisy sensor inputs. Performance was evaluated under varying conditions of time lag, Gaussian noise, and number of sensors. Results show that the SHRED model performs reliably across noise levels, benefits from increased sensor count, and is largely insensitive to lag length, highlighting its robustness for environmental modeling tasks.

## Introduction

Accurate reconstruction of environmental data like SST is vital for climate modeling, weather prediction, and ecosystem monitoring. Traditional sensing methods often require dense and expensive sensor networks. SHRED offers a promising alternative, using LSTM networks to model temporal dependencies and a shallow decoder to reconstruct high-dimensional spatial fields from a sparse set of sensors.

This study evaluates SHREDâ€™s performance using the NOAA Optimum Interpolation SST V2 dataset by testing its robustness against time lags, input noise, and varying sensor configurations.

## Methodology

### SHRED Overview

SHRED integrates:
- **LSTM network**: Captures temporal dependencies from time-lagged sensor sequences.
- **Shallow decoder**: Reconstructs the full spatio-temporal SST field from the LSTM output.

### Data Preprocessing

- SST data is normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
- Input sequences are generated for each time window using randomly selected sensor locations.
- Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.

### Model Training

- The `run_shred()` function initializes sensor placement, creates input/output datasets, trains the SHRED model using PyTorch, and evaluates reconstruction accuracy via mean squared error (MSE).
- Experiments were conducted with varying:
  - **Noise levels**: Gaussian noise added to input data.
  - **Time lags**: Number of previous time steps used.
  - **Sensor counts**: Number of sensors sampled from the spatial field.

## Experiments

### 1. Noise-Free Training

```python
mse, recons, truth = run_shred(num_sensors=3, lags=52)
```
**Test Error:** 0.0349

### 2. Performance Under Gaussian Noise

Noise was added to sensor data with standard deviation ranging from 0.0 to 0.5. Despite noise, test error remained stable.

### 3. Performance vs Time Lag

```python
lag_val = [13, 32, 52, 71, 91, 110, 130, 149, 169, 188]
```

> Insight: MSE does not vary significantly with lag, indicating robustness to temporal history length.

### 4. Performance vs Number of Sensors

```python
sensor_num = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20]
```

> Insight: Increasing the number of sensors consistently reduces reconstruction error, confirming that more spatial input improves accuracy.

## Conclusion

The SHRED model effectively reconstructs SST fields from sparse, noisy data. Key findings:
- **Noise Tolerance:** Performance remains stable across a wide range of noise levels.
- **Sensor Sensitivity:** More sensors lead to lower reconstruction errors.
- **Lag Insensitivity:** Varying lag length has minimal effect on accuracy.

These results validate SHRED as a powerful tool for spatio-temporal field reconstruction with limited sensor availability, making it suitable for real-world environmental monitoring and forecasting applications.
